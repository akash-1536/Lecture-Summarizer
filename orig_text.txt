{"Hi. Last time, we talked about nvcc method and how to reduce the number of equations. We had to deal with to solve a particular circuit. At this point. We're pretty well-equipped to self circuits in the general sense, but we really haven't talked about how to use that information or possibly use Targets in a particular way. Before we jump into both that and obstruction of circuits. We need to talk about offense. Offense is short for operational amplifier, and it's the tool that we can use in order to sample particular voltages from a subsection of a circuit without affecting it. Another thing we can use offense to do is modifier signal, or if we're going to sample, the voltage for a Tickler subsection of the Circuit week and then do stuff to that voltage without affecting the circuit.
